## Projects

- [**Dev Icons ðŸš€**](http://devicons.dev.br/)

  Dev Icons is a platform created especially for people who want to standardize their GitHub profile using the icons provided by the Dev Icons API.
Following all market standards, Dev Icons uses the highest technologies such as: AWS, IaaC with Terraform, Pipelines with GitActions for automatic deployment, Python, Flask, JavaScript, Html and CSS

- [**Complete project of Microservices:**](https://github.com/patrickpiccini/MS-Application)

  A project that goes through different stages of architecture and software development with the main focus on the creation of microservices, where several services communicate through a message broker, thus making the application not have any dependencies, which can cause the unavailability of the entire application.
Different technologies were used such as: OCI, Docker, Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, Python and some language paradigms that can be noticed during the project.

- [**Spotify Wrapped:**](https://github.com/patrickpiccini/DataScience_Spotify_Wrapped)

  It seeks to replicate a feature of the Spotify streaming platform called "Spotify Wrapped", which brings a retrospective of the songs, artists, among others, most listened to during its year.
For this, it will be worked only with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), being the primordial concept for Machine Learning.

- [**Prediction of Heart Failure:**](https://github.com/patrickpiccini/heart-failure-prediction)

  It classifies patients according to tests done and different factors resulting in whether or not the person can receive a diagnosis of heart failure. Therefore, this project deals with data analysis, manipulation and visualization, so that different classification algorithms can be tested, resulting in a Machine Leaing model responsible for predicting a diagnosis of heart failure in patients.
